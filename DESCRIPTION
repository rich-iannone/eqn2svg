Description: If you have a mathematical formula and the need to have that
    formula in the form of 'scalable vector graphics' ('SVG'), you'll be
    delighted by what 'eqn2svg' will let you do. The incoming 'LaTeX' formula
    will be nicely converted to 'SVG' tags. And you can use that code wherever
    'SVGs' are accepted.
